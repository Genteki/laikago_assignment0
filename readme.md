Here is an assignment based on https://github.com/H-Y-H-Y-H/pybullet_robots

## Environment

**laikago.py** contains the enviroment class of laikago whose action spaces includes 12 joints. But it's too complicated.

**laikago_dof4.py** is the version I finally use. I reduce the dof to simply the complexity of RL. Though the robot looks stupid, it could move forward anyway...
